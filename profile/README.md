## For CodeHex16 Members
<!-- asking to use vscode workspace to have a same develop enviroment -->
For the best development experience, we recommend using the provided Visual Studio Code workspace. This will ensure that everyone has the same development environment. [Download the workspace here](https://codehex16.github.io/resources/workspace/vscode_workspace_v0.1.0.zip).
1. Download the workspace.
2. Extract the contents of the zip file.
3. Run the ```RUN.bat``` file or ```RUN.sh``` file depending on your operating system. (I haven't test .sh file yet)
4. Open the file ```SWE.code-workspace``` with Visual Studio Code.
